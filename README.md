# Heart-Disease-Detection

Heart disease remains one of the most prevalent causes of mortality
worldwide, accounting for millions of deaths annually. Early detection
and intervention are crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality
associated with cardiovascular conditions. Traditional methods for
diagnosing heart disease rely on clinical evaluations, imaging studies,
and laboratory tests, which can be time-consuming and may not always
be accessible to all patients. As a result, there is a growing interest in
utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to improve predictive
accuracy and provide scalable, data-driven insights into cardiovascular
risk. This project investigates the application of various machine learning
algorithms for heart disease prediction, utilizing a structured dataset that
contains medical and clinical information, such as patient age, cholesterol
levels, blood pressure, and ECG results. By employing models such as
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks, we aim to identify which model
achieves the highest predictive accuracy and best balances
interpretability with predictive performance. The dataset used, the
Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, is one of the most widely recognized
benchmarks for cardiovascular risk prediction and offers a robust
foundation for model training and evaluation. Each algorithm’s
performance is evaluated using standard metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, to provide a comprehensive
comparison. Additionally, we conducted hyperparameter tuning and
cross-validation to optimize each model’s performance, ensuring the
reliability and generalizability of the results.
